# Two-Wheeler Safety System

The Two-Wheeler Safety System is an innovative project developed as part of my Embedded Systems course. It serves a crucial role in enhancing the safety of two-wheeler riders. Here are the key features of this system:

## Project Highlights:

- **Helmet Detection:** The system uses computer vision techniques to detect whether a rider is wearing a helmet or not. This feature promotes helmet usage, a critical aspect of two-wheeler safety.

- **Live Data to Mobile:** It seamlessly integrates with Firebase to send real-time information about helmet usage to a mobile application. This enables both riders and authorities to monitor safety compliance.

- **Automatic Indicator Control:** The system goes a step further by automatically controlling the indicators of the bike based on the tilt angle of the gyroscope. This enhances visibility and safety, especially during turns and lane changes.

## Course Project:

I developed this project as part of my Embedded Systems course. It showcases my skills in hardware integration, computer vision, and real-time data communication. This project not only demonstrates my technical competence but also my commitment to enhancing road safety for two-wheeler riders.
